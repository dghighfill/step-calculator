# Step Calculator

The basic problem is that for a desk job lifestyle, it makes it hard to get your steps in.  To come home and find that you've only hit 2500 steps for the day for a 10,000 step goal day is frustrating.  The Step Calculator will calculate the difference that you need to walk to fill the gap when you arrive at home.  Walks in the evening after dinner are good as it burns off the calories before you go to bed.

First you need to figure out how mahy steps you walk in a mile.  For me that's 1896 = 1 mile.  This will be used in the formula to calculate how much you need to walk to meet your goal.

Goal - Daily Steps Taken - Steps in a mile = X miles to walk to meet your goal.

## Example

Your goal is to walk 10,000 steps per day.  Say you 3765 steps when you arrive home and you would like to know how many steps to walk meet your goal.

10,000 - 3,765 = 6,235 steps to take.
6,235 / 1,896 = 3.28 miles.

10,000 / 1896 = 5.27 miles per day.
